# Military Communication - Army Green
## A theme for Home Assistant.

This is my first project for HA/Hacs/GitHub. So bear with me if something is not right.

It has two sub-themes. Which can be used for individual cards (See screenshot). These are not ment to be used as main theme.
- CARD2: A gray background
- CARD3: A lighter green with more texture.

Install via Hacs on Home Assistant.

Or if you have to manually install it: Move/copy the image files to /www/milcomarmy/

I am not able to test this with all cards. So if you find something that looks wrong, please inform me.
