# STOP   Please wait to try this until I remove this message! I need to test a few things.

A theme for Home Assistant.

It has two sub-themes. Which can be used for individual cards (See screenshot). These are not ment to be used as main theme.
- CARD2: A gray background
- CARD3: A lighter green with more texture.

I am not able to test this with all cards. So if you find something that looks wrong, please inform me.

This is my first project on GitHub. So bear with me if something is not right.
